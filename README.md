# my-first-blog

This project is creating my first blog based on the tutorial from djangogirls (https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/).

It is creating a blog website using python with django, as well as structuring with html and formatting with css.

## Features
- Create a blog application based on the Django framework in Python
- Save blog posts in an sqlite database
- Ability to create, edit and delete posts directly from application
- Application is published using Azure App service

## History

8/2/2025 - I've worked on and completed the main tutorial section of this blog tutorial.  It was a lot of fun going through and I feel like I've learned a lot. I learned the basic structure
           of a django applicaton, html, css and how they interact with each other.  For example how you can have html elements perform Python functions. I went through the main tutorial and
           have a published web application. The functionality includes: 
           
- viewing all posts in a list
 - Viewing a single post in detail view
- Making a new post
- Editing a post

The tutorial goes through publishing it to pythonanywhere, but since I already have a Microsoft Azure subscription and I've been learning the
developer certification, I wanted to publish it there. I was able to complete it successfully.  This repository is directly linked to the web app so any changes I work on and push
here, a github action triggers and publishes to the app, which is cool to watch.  Ideally you'd want it to go to a development slot first to verify it looks ok, but this works
well enough for now while learning.  The tutorial has several "extra credit" posts to add more functionality. so I'm going to go through those next. I'm looking forward to it
